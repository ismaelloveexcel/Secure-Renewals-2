Full-stack app

Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL (async SQLAlchemy + Alembic migrations)

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

HR modules present in code/docs: employees, contract renewals, onboarding, passes, attendance, templates, notifications, audit logs, employee documents, bank details, compliance tracking, recruitment

A lot of operational documentation under /docs (implementation plans, UAE process notes, recruitment research, health checks, etc.)

The ZIP also includes heavy dev artifacts: .git/, .local/, .config/ and a large attached_assets/ folder.

2) HR Strategist feedback (process + governance)
What’s strong

You’re covering the employee lifecycle beyond renewals: compliance fields (visa/EID/ILOE/medical), documents, onboarding, basic HR ops, recruitment.

Role concept exists (admin / hr / viewer) and there are signs of approval workflow thinking (e.g., bank details submit/approve pattern).

High-risk HR governance issues (must fix)

Sensitive HR data is inside the repo/ZIP

Employees-Employee Database- Github.csv contains DOB, salary, allowances, visa status, phone, email, manager data.

/attached_assets/ contains candidate resumes (PII).

This is a major confidentiality + audit exposure (and in UAE context, also a PDPL/data handling risk).
HR action: classify this as Restricted HR Data and enforce a policy: no PII/salary/CVs in source control or build artifacts.

Credentialing model risk

First-time login uses DOB in DDMMYYYY as password (even if forced change later).

HR reality: DOB is commonly known/shared → this is weak for protecting salary/bank/compliance data.

Viewer access vs “need-to-know”

The app stores and returns compensation fields in employee schemas.

If “viewer” is meant for managers/general staff, you need strict field-level access control (salary shouldn’t be broadly visible).

HR process enhancements (practical, UAE-leaning)

Implement a single “Compliance Calendar” per employee:

Contract end, visa expiry, Emirates ID expiry, medical fitness expiry, ILOE, insurance renewal

Automated reminders at 120/90/60/30 days with clear owner: HR vs manager vs employee.

Add standard renewal decision workflow:

“Renew / Do not renew / Pending budget / Pending performance review”

Attach approval + justification + audit log.

Define retention schedule:

CVs, employee documents, salary history, audit logs — retention + deletion rules (very relevant for UAE compliance posture).

3) IT Engineer feedback (security, architecture, deployment)
Critical security & data-handling issues

PII in repo + build artifact

The ZIP includes .git/ (≈35MB) and attached_assets/ (≈8MB) and the employee CSV.

This means:

Accidentally shipping history, branches, old files

Accidentally leaking resumes and salary data
Fix: build artifacts must contain only runtime code/assets.

Authorization gaps (object-level security)

I found at least one employee endpoint that allows viewer to fetch employee details by ID (and schemas include salary/DOB/etc.).

Frontend hiding links is not security. You need server-side checks like:

viewer can only access self

manager can access direct reports

HR/admin can access all
This is one of the most important fixes for a real HR system.

Authentication approach

DOB-as-initial-password is fragile.
Safer alternatives (lowest risk first):

SSO (Azure AD / Entra ID) for HR/admin

For employees: one-time onboarding token sent to company email (time-bound) → set password on first login

Add lockout / throttling + MFA (even if lightweight)

Document storage

Document upload currently writes to local path (uploads/documents).

For HR docs you want: encrypted object storage (Azure Blob), private access, expiring links, antivirus scan, and audit logs.

Engineering hygiene issues that will bite you

CI workflow is currently broken

.github/workflows/ci.yml has a YAML indentation error (a step is indented incorrectly), so CI won’t run reliably.

It also references action versions like actions/checkout@v6 / actions/setup-python@v6 which are suspicious and should be verified.

Dependency consistency

Backend uses slowapi but it’s not in backend/pyproject.toml dependencies.

Some parsing features are “optional imports” (good), but you should formalize them as optional extras, e.g. .[resume].

Two auth implementations

Some routes use app.core.security.require_role, others use app.auth.dependencies.require_role.

That inconsistency is a common source of security regressions. Pick one and standardize.

UAE-specific infra consideration (important)

Your deploy_to_azure.sh defaults to eastus. If you host employee PII outside the region, you may create cross-border transfer obligations depending on your internal policy and contracts.

At minimum: choose region intentionally (e.g., UAE region if required), document it, and align with HR/legal stance.

4) Priority actions (what I’d do first)
P0 — stop-the-bleeding (same week)

Remove employee CSV + attached resumes from repository and ZIP distribution process.

Purge sensitive files from git history (if this repo is shared).

Remove .git/, .local/, .config/ from any deployment/build artifact.

Implement object-level authorization rules (viewer self-only, manager direct reports, HR/admin full).

Replace DOB-first-password with invite token / email-based onboarding (or SSO).

P1 — harden for real use (next 2–4 weeks)

Move documents to secure blob storage with encryption + access controls.

Fix CI pipeline; add:

backend unit tests + API auth tests

dependency vulnerability scanning

Add field-level controls for compensation + bank + IDs (HR-only by default).

Formalize retention policy + audit reporting (HR and IT both care).

5) Bottom line

The foundation is solid (modules + FastAPI/React structure + lots of planning docs), but right now the ZIP shows real operational risk because it bundles HR PII, resumes, and git history, and there are likely authorization gaps that could expose salary/compliance data to unintended roles.
