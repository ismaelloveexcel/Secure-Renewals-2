Refactor the Candidate Pass so that:

All menus render inside the Pass container (no downward expansion, no routing).

Actions Required are handled centrally and contextually.

Past actions are recorded via a system Activity Log (audit-ready), with controlled visibility.

🔒 CORE UX & SYSTEM PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

Candidate Pass is a fixed shell

Header (candidate info)

Journey timeline

Current stage & status

Action Required (persistent CTA zone)

Content Area (dynamic)

Bottom menu (fixed)

Bottom menu is NOT navigation

No route change

No accordion / expand-down behavior

Clicking a menu only swaps content inside the Pass

Actions ≠ History

Actions = what the candidate must do now

History = immutable record of what already happened

These must never be mixed

🧠 REQUIRED ARCHITECTURE CHANGE

Replace all expandable or page-based behavior with state-driven rendering.

Example:

activeTab = 'home' | 'documents' | 'calendar' | 'engage'


CandidatePassContainer remains static

Only ContentArea updates

No scroll jump, no page reload

🧩 MENU → CONTENT MAPPING
1. Home (default tab)

Journey overview

Current stage & status

Activity History (collapsed, read-only, sanitized)

Shows major milestones only

Pulled from Activity Log where visibility = candidate

2. Documents

Upload / review / download documents

Renders inside ContentArea only

3. Calendar (IMPORTANT)

Render as split-view inside the Pass, not a page.

LEFT PANEL

Monthly calendar

Interview indicators (scheduled / available)

Read-only for candidates

RIGHT PANEL
Contextual Interview Details:

No interview → “No interview scheduled”

If scheduled:

Interview type

Date & time (timezone-aware)

Mode (Online / Onsite)

Interviewer(s)

Meeting link / location

Instructions

❌ No full-page calendar
❌ No expansion below the Pass

4. Engage

Contact HR

Submit feedback

Ask a question

Communication history (candidate-visible only)

🎯 ACTIONS REQUIRED (CRITICAL)
Placement

Directly below Journey Timeline, as a persistent Action Required section.

Rules

Max ONE primary action at a time

Auto-updates based on stage + status

Disappears when no action is required

Actions trigger Activity Log entries

Examples

Application → Complete Profile

Interview → Confirm Interview

Offer → Review & Sign Offer

Onboarding → Upload Documents

🧾 PAST ACTIONS / AUDIT TRAIL (SYSTEM RECORD)
REQUIRED BACKEND TABLE

Create an immutable Activity Log.

Suggested structure:

ActivityLog
- id
- candidate_id
- stage
- action_type
- action_description
- performed_by (candidate | HR | system)
- performed_by_id (nullable)
- timestamp
- visibility (internal | candidate)

Logging Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Log all state-changing actions:

Application submitted

Status changes

Interviews scheduled / completed

Documents uploaded

Offers sent / accepted / declined

Onboarding initiated

No edits. No deletes.

👁️ VISIBILITY RULES
Internal (HR / Hiring Manager)

Full Activity Log

All actions

All metadata

Candidate Pass

Only entries where visibility = candidate

Displayed under:
Home → Activity History (collapsed)

❌ No internal notes
❌ No recruiter comments
❌ No scorecards

🧱 FINAL STRUCTURE (LOCK THIS)
CandidatePassContainer
 ├─ Header
 ├─ JourneyTimeline
 ├─ ActionRequired   ← primary CTA zone
 ├─ ContentArea      ← swaps by activeTab
 │    ├─ Home
 │    │    └─ ActivityHistory (collapsed)
 │    ├─ Documents
 │    ├─ Calendar (split view)
 │    └─ Engage
 └─ BottomMenu (fixed)


ContentArea scrolls internally

Bottom menu always visible

🚫 EXPLICITLY DISALLOWED

Expand-down menus

Full-page calendar

Separate history screens for candidates

Mixing actions with history

Deletable or editable logs

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Clicking any menu:

Does NOT scroll the page

Does NOT expand downward

Does NOT change route

Only swaps content inside the Pass

Every meaningful action creates an Activity Log entry

Candidate sees only sanitized history

System retains full audit trail

Deliverable:
Refactor existing Candidate Pass components and backend to comply with the above. Prioritize structure, behavior, and data integrity over visual redesign.
