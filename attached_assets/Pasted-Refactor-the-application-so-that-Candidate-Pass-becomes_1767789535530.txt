Refactor the application so that Candidate Pass becomes the MASTER template for all Passes (Candidate, Manager, future Offer / Onboarding / Employee).

All Passes must:

Use the Candidate Pass layout hierarchy

Use internal tab switching (no routing, no expand-down)

Support Action Required, Activity History, and Audit Logging

Manager Pass must be refactored to conform to the Candidate Pass template, not the other way around.

🔒 GLOBAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

A Pass is a fixed container

Nothing inside a Pass opens a new page

Nothing expands downward outside the Pass

All interactions stay inside the Pass shell

Bottom menu is NOT navigation

No route changes

No page reloads

Clicking a menu item swaps content inside the Pass

One active content view at a time

Controlled by internal state only

🧱 MASTER PASS TEMPLATE (FROM CANDIDATE PASS)

All passes must follow this exact structure:

BasePassContainer (fixed)
 ├─ Header
 │   ├─ Title (Candidate Name / Role / Entity)
 │   ├─ Subtext (Role, Dept, Reference ID)
 │   └─ Status Badge (+ SLA if applicable)
 ├─ Journey / Progress (optional per pass)
 ├─ Action Required (if applicable)
 ├─ ContentArea   ← dynamic, tab-driven
 └─ BottomMenu    ← fixed, always visible


This structure is derived from Candidate Pass and is now canonical.

🧠 REQUIRED ARCHITECTURE CHANGE

Implement state-driven content rendering.

Example:

activeTab = 'home' | 'documents' | 'calendar' | 'engage'


The BasePassContainer never unmounts

Only ContentArea changes

Scroll is confined to ContentArea

📑 CANDIDATE PASS — REQUIRED BEHAVIOUR
Bottom Menu (fixed)

Home

Documents

Calendar

Engage

1. Home

Journey timeline

Current stage & status

Action Required (primary CTA zone)

Activity History (collapsed, read-only, candidate-visible only)

2. Documents

Document list

Upload / download

Rendered inside ContentArea only

3. Calendar

Render as embedded split-view, NOT a page.

LEFT PANEL

Monthly calendar

Interview indicators (scheduled / available)

RIGHT PANEL

Interview details:

No interview → empty state message

If scheduled:

Interview type

Date & time (timezone-aware)

Mode (Online / Onsite)

Interviewer(s)

Meeting link / location

Instructions

❌ No full-page calendar
❌ No expand-down behaviour

4. Engage

Contact HR

Submit feedback

Ask a question

Communication history (candidate-visible only)

🎯 ACTION REQUIRED (CRITICAL)
Placement

Directly below Journey / Progress.

Rules

Max ONE primary action at a time

Auto-derived from stage + status

Clicking an action:

Performs the action

Writes an Activity Log entry

Hidden when no action is required

Examples

Application → Complete Profile

Interview → Confirm Interview

Offer → Review & Sign Offer

Onboarding → Upload Documents

🧾 ACTIVITY LOG (SYSTEM-WIDE AUDIT TRAIL)
Backend (MANDATORY)

Implement a single immutable Activity Log shared by all Passes.

Suggested schema:

ActivityLog
- id
- entity_type (candidate | requisition | interview)
- entity_id
- stage
- action_type
- action_description
- performed_by (candidate | manager | HR | system)
- performed_by_id
- timestamp
- visibility (internal | candidate)

Logging Rules

Log every state-changing action

No edits

No deletes

System-safe, audit-ready

👁️ VISIBILITY RULES
Candidate Pass

Only show entries where visibility = candidate

Display under:
Home → Activity History (collapsed)

Manager / HR Pass

Full visibility

Full metadata

Chronological timeline

🔁 MANAGER PASS — REQUIRED REFACTOR

Manager Pass must adopt the Candidate Pass template.

Changes required:

Replace dashboard-heavy layout with Pass layout

Remove KPI cards from header

Move KPIs into Home / Overview tab

Keep bottom menu + internal tab switching

Add Action Required section (e.g. Review candidates, Approve setup)

Manager Bottom Menu (example mapping)

Home (Overview)

Documents

Calendar

HR / Communication

Same behaviour. Same container. Same rules.

🚫 STRICTLY DISALLOWED (ANY PASS)

Downward-expanding menus

Page-based routing inside a pass

Multiple content panels visible at once

Mixing actions with history

Editable or deletable activity logs

Different interaction models per pass type

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Candidate Pass remains visually unchanged but structurally correct

Manager Pass visually adapts to Candidate Pass template

Menu clicks swap content only

Calendar is embedded, split-view

Action Required is always contextual

Every meaningful action writes to ActivityLog

Candidate sees only sanitized history

📦 Deliverable

Refactor the Pass system so Candidate Pass is the master template, Manager Pass conforms to it, and all behaviour (menus, actions, history) is standardised and future-proof.

Strategic Note

You are building a Pass Framework, not screens.
Once this is locked, Offer Pass and Onboarding Pass become trivial.
